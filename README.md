### Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Python.

### How to Play
1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to place their mark (X or O) in an empty cell.
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all 9 cells are filled and no player has 3 in a row, the game is a draw.

### Implementation Details
- The game is implemented using a class `TicTacToe2`.
- The class manages the game state, including the board and the current player.
- The game loop continues until there is a winner or the board is full.

### How to Run the Game
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Run the script using the command `python <script_name>.py`.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
